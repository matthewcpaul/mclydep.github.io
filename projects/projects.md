##Projects I'm currently working on
####I. The Dinner Table
There is so much knowledge being shard around me. On Monday, a FEDucation speaker series, Tuesday a meeting about a poster show on the 7th floor kitchen, Wednesday another FEDucation talk... man, that's a **lot** of knowledge. It just keeps coming. We all read different books, build different things, learn different ways.

This is a simple idea: let's collect that knowledge for future aspiring design developers and creative technologists.

**Welcome to The Dinner Table. What did you learn today?**

####II. Comma
The notebook for all of your selves. A spineless hardcover notebook, similar in size to an ipad, with a cover similar to Frank Chimero's *Shape of Design*, in which softcover notebooks snap in and out with the help of magnets. In the creative industry, we don't have to conform to one title. It's worth specializing, but we're always learning new things and need a place for each skill we learn.

####III. Dudelr
Daily-ish doodles of silly ideas, puns, and sub-culture. Drawing fast with minimal digital clean up to improve my skill in illustrating complex concepts and gain more confidence in drawing.

####IV. Typeahead
A blog about web typography. Yet to find the niche I want to be in here, but the idea is to help progress the landscape of web typography.
